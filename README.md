# RandomGameSelector
I made this to read my Excel list of games. It uses in the same folder as the exe an Excel doc named Game_Lists with a sheet named Game_List with a column named Recordable with the rows without "yes" deleted. It uses some sprites from Oracle of Ages and the EPPlus library with the Noncommercial License.
